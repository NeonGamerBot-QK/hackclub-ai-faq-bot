High seas is a follow up to low skies. it released on Oct 30th and was featured in a Github key note!.
Hey everyone, welcome to the High Seas Bulletin! Keep an eye on this channel for all manner of announcements, updates, and special events happening for the thirteen weeks of High Seas :heart:
> Sunbeams glint off the rippling water like brilliant daggers, stabbing your eyes in a much more pleasing way than a literal eye-stabbing. You inhale deeply. The aromas of the beach tickle your brain like a loving yet irritatingly domineering older sibling. Salt. Kelp. Rotting… fish, probably. Yup, some dead thing with fins is definitely decomposing nearby, microbes slowly transmuting it into a pungent cocktail of greenhouse gasses and putrescine aimlessly rising to heaven. Even fish can fly, if only in death :power-of-an-angel:A tremor from below disturbs the peace. Grains of sand vibrate across your toenails like droplets of water skittering across a hot pan. Suddenly a trio of tall wooden masts breach the surface of the water, followed by sails, followed by the wooden hull of a gargantuan 18th-century ship shooting out of the water and into the air like a nerf football released from the bottom of a pool. The ship cartoonishly hangs in the air before crashing into the sea with a terrific SPLOOSH, creating a tremendous wave that rushes to shore and knocks you over with the overwhelming force of a friendly but overeager and poorly-trained doberman. The whole shebang is over in seconds, leaving you stunned, sprawled on the beach, covered in seaweed. You raise your head to see a dinosaur with an eyepatch gazing down at you from the mighty prow of the ship. A raccoon with a spyglass has climbed the rigging for a better view of your sogginess."Aye, a landlubber!! Ahoy new friend!!!!" cries the raccoon. The dinosaur smiles and nods excitedly, fussing with her eyepatch to get it on the other eye, both of which seem to be intact. "I am Captain Trashbeard, and this is my First Mate Arrpheus!! Behold our schooner, Le Dumpstairè, the finest pirate vessel in the Caribbean, feared by all who sail these waters!! Come, come aboard!!!!"Arrpheus drops a rope ladder from the gunwales, the final wooden step landing in the water below with a miniscule sploosh while dinosaur hooves above awkwardly and furiously beckon you forth. You pick yourself up off the beach, unsure what to do. This sort of thing doesn't usually happen to you. You look down at your phone and open the calendar. It's empty. You look up at the pirate ship. It's full. Of possibilities. Metaphorically, anyway, you can't see the interior. Unease gives way to resolve; fueled by a supernatural drive for adventure, your fear is left on the beach to watch you wade into the ocean, swim to the ladder, grasp the first rung, and climb aboard this maritime relic. And so began your new life as a pirate.
Some of you have already seen the GitHub keynote. For everyone else, I am pleased to inform you…:parrot::sparkles: Today is Day 1 of High Seas. :sparkles::pirate-ship:For the next thirteen weeks, we will send you free stuff just for coding.

—The High Seas Team :saluting_face:
Setting off into the High Seas (Getting Started)!
What does the setup script do?
The script automatically installs the Wakatime extension if you have Visual Studio Code installed and connects it to Hackatime - our custom server for High Seas. It then sends us a heartbeat so we know you’ve successfully set it up. You can look at the full script here for Linux/macOS or here for Windows.
What if it errors?
Don’t fret! If something goes wrong, click the “Or, skip for now” button and continue with the tutorial. 
Why have I not got an invite to Slack?
If you don’t see an invite in your inbox, make sure to check your spam folder and wait a few minutes. If you still don’t see it after waiting a few minutes, please email highseas@hackclub.com from the email you signed up with, using the subject “Not received High Seas Slack invite”.
Why can’t I do anything?
Check your DMs with Slackbot. You should have a message telling you to make your way to the Harbor. From here, you can complete the tutorial to graduate Pirate Academy.
Why am I getting an error that I am not authorised to install High Seas on Hack Club?
Multi-Channel guests are not able to connect to High Seas through the Slack login. Once your verification is accepted, you will be upgraded to a full slack user and the Slack login will work. Until your verification is accepted, please use the link that was sent to you in direct messages!
Projects & the Shipyard
What can I use to log time?
We use a custom Wakatime server, but we have some limits on the extensions you can use. Anything listed below works for High Seas though!
Any JetBrains IDE* • plugins
Any Eclipse tooling* • plugins
Arduino IDE • Plugin
Brackets • Plugin
Delphi • Plugin
Any VSCode based editor * • Plugin
HBuilderX • Plugin
Ida • Plugin
Komodo • Plugin
Neovim • Plugin
Notepad++ • Plugin
Siyuan • Plugin
Sublime • Text Plugin
TeXStudio • Plugin
Zed • Plugin
Emacs • Plugin
*Not all versions of these editors support plugins/extensions which means we won’t be able to support those versions. 

To set up the extensions, run the command from the Signpost which will configure the plugins to connect to Hakatime, our Wakatime server.
What projects are accepted for High Seas?
Anything that you programmed and logged with the extension! We are not accepting non-programming projects for High Seas. (we may in the future, though)
Can I do a group project?
Yup! Just all work on separate hackatime accounts and submit separately but use the same repo! We would actually encourage you to do a group project, as it is a really cool experience to build something big with others.
Do I have to use GitHub?
Nope! You can use any Git host, but we recommend using GitHub as it’s an industry standard.
Does my project need to be open source?
Yes! Your project needs to be on a Git repository that’s publicly accessible
How do I ship a project?
To ship your project, you need to visit the Shipyard to draft a new ship. Once you’re happy with it, you can ship it to the Wonderdome where it’ll get peer-voted before your doubloons are given out.
What are the requirements for a shipped project?
A shipped project must be shared in a way that other people can experience to the greatest possible extent.

Your repo needs a README with:
Screenshots and/or videos of your project in action
Description of your project
A live URL, release or deployment for the project (see below)
Steps on how to use your project

If all else fails, you can publish it to GitHub including everything necessary to run the project (requirements.txt, package.json).
Keep in mind that the goal is to make your project accessible to others & everyone has different versions of languages and different dependencies installed. Don’t assume they know how to run your project!
What should a demo link be?
A demo link should be something that people can visit and experience your project. Here are some examples:
A Python package published to PyPi
A Minecraft mod published to Modrinth or Hangar 
Publishing a website on your domain
A game published on Itch
If there's no way for other people to experience it themselves, you can upload a video to YouTube and link that.
Doubloons & the Wonderdome
How do I get doubloons?
You get doubloons after your project is sent to the Wonderdome and receives enough votes. You can see the amount of votes your projects have in the Shipyard.
What determines how many doubloons I get?
The amount of doubloons you get paid from the Wonderdome is dependent on how many hours you put into your project and how it ranks against projects with similar numbers of hours.
Why do I need to vote on projects?
We use the votes to figure out the quality of projects for doubloon payouts. It also gets people using your projects!
What happens to my vote reasons? 
We don't share your feedback on the projects with the authors. It's just used for making sure your votes are legitimate and to improve the system.

Shop
Does (x) ship to (y)?
Check the shop! You can select your region and everything in the shop will ship to you!
Can I change my order later?
No. All orders are final. You cannot cancel or modify the details of them after purchasing them so make sure you choose wisely. 
What if my order can’t be fulfilled?
We will issue you a full refund of your doubloons if we are unable to fulfil your order.
Do I have to pay?
No. The prizes and shipping are entirely paid for by Hack Club. Your country may charge you a customs duty on certain items, however.
Will Hack Club cover customs fees?
No. Hack Club cannot cover customs fees for you. Customs duties are fees that your country requires you to pay to receive packages internationally above a certain value. You must pay these duties to get your prize. You should check your country’s Government website to help predict what the costs will be. If you are unable to pay the associated customs fees, do not purchase an item because that prize will get destroyed.
How can I see everything coming to me?
This Shipment Viewer will show everything that is on its way to you from our warehouse with tracking links if they are available. Anything ordered on your behalf from a different vendor will not show up here.
Verification
Who can participate in High Seas?
Anyone 18 or under can participate in High Seas! If you are still in high school, over 18 and in the United States or Canada you can also participate in High Seas.
Why do I have to verify?
We need to make sure that you’re a high school student. Unfortunately, lots of adults like pretending to be kids to get free stuff, so we need to make sure you’re actually who you say you are.
What form of ID is accepted?
United States 🇺🇸 / Australia 🇦🇺 / Canada 🇨🇦 / Singapore 🇸🇬 - Either of the following:
Government issued ID (drivers license, NRIC card, FIN card, passport)
A school ID and your most recent report card / transcript
India 🇮🇳
Only a PDF of an Aadhaar Card. Not a generic school ID.
We will only accept a PDF of your Aadhar Card downloaded from the DigiLocker Website or UIDAI Website (masked Aadhar is ok), you can find the DigiLocker instructions here.
United Kingdom 🇬🇧 - Either of the following:
A government issued ID (eg. drivers license or passport), or
A dated school ID (no report card / transcript needed)
Other 🏳️
A government issued document with your date of birth, name and photo.
What if my verification was rejected?
You can reapply here! You can find your Slack ID by running /sdt whoami in Slack. If you are struggling, please ask in #high-seas-help and someone will help you.
Other Stuff!
Why is (x feature) not working properly?
The team is aware of issues and is working super hard to fix them! If you don’t think they’re aware of an issue, please send a message in #high-seas-help with the issue.
When will the High Seas drain?
High Seas will end on January 31st 2025. More information about how the event will wrap up will be released closer to the time.

If you’ve got more questions that haven’t been answered here, please ask them to post them in #high-seas-help
