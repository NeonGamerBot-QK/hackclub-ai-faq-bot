WELCOME TO :tw_sparkles::cloud: LOW SKIES :cloud::tw_sparkles:: Hack Club's 10 hours in public heir two-week event where you build, battle, and power up!
How this works:
Work on personal projects! Use Hackatime to keep track of amount of time spent.
Enter finished projects into the Thunderdome! When you ship your project, it will battle against other projects, as you and your peers vote between them in 1v1 matchups.
Once your project has done ten battles, you'll get :sky-scales: Scales (taken straight from... your opponent's dragon?) based on how many hours you spent on it—and how it performed in the Thunderdome. Spend :sky-scales: Scales in the Shoppe for rewards, from Blahajs to Yubikeys!
